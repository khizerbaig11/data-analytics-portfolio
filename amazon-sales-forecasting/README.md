- SQL (data extraction & cleaning)

## ✅ Highlights
- Cleaned and prepared historical Amazon sales data.
- Built and tuned a Huber Regressor to handle outliers and improve prediction accuracy.
- Reduced MAPE by 18% compared to baseline linear models.
- Deployed model with Flask for local API calls.
